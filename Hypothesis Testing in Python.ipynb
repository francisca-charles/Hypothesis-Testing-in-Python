    "### Why is t needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "The process for calculating p-values is to start with the sample statistic, standardize it to get a test statistic, then transform it via a cumulative distribution function. In Chapter 1, that final transformation was denoted $z$, and the CDF transformation used the (standard normal) z-distribution. In the last video, the test statistic was denoted $t$ , and the transformation used the t-distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "In which hypothesis testing scenario is a t-distribution needed instead of the z-distribution?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Answer the question\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Possible Answers\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "- The t-distribution is just another name for the z-distribution, so they can be used interchangeably. ❌\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- The t-distribution is the same thing as the z-distribution for very small sample sizes. ❌\n",
    "   \n",
    "    \n",
    "- When a sample standard deviation is used in estimating a standard error. ✔\n",
    "   \n",
    "    \n",
    "- When you are comparing the means of three or more samples, rather than comparing a single sample mean to a value. ❌\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The t-distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "The t-distribution is used to calculate the p-value from the $t$ test statistic, and having a sense of how the PDF and CDF look can help you understand this calculation. It has two parameters: the degrees of freedom, and the non-centrality parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The plots show the PDF and CDF for a t-distribution (solid black line), and for comparison show a normal distribution with the same mean and variance (gray dotted line).\n",
    "\n",
    "Which statement about the the t-distribution is true?\n",
